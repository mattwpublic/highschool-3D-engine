# highschool-3D-engine
a basic 3d "engine" I made in highschool. most of the code was copied from a tutorial series on how to make a 3d engine in java.

# Installation/Running:

1. Download and install the Eclipse IDE
2. Clone this repository somewhere you wont forget
3. Import the folder titled "3DEngine" into eclipse as a new project.
4. Run "Display.java" located at ```../srs/pkg/Display.java```
5. Success!

# Controls:

- Use WASD to move around
- Use the arrow keys to look around
- Hold Shift to sprint
- Press space to "jump" (more accurately, to hover strangely)
